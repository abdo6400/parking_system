Car parking is a major issue in modern congested cities of today. There simply are
too many vehicles on the road and not enough parking space. This has led to the
need for efficient parking management systems. Thus, we demonstrate the use of
IOT based parking management system that allows for efficient parking space
utilization using IOT technology.
